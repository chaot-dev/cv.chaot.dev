  title: Profile
  summary: |
    Sysop with 10 years of experience in busineses ranging from middle-market companies to global cooperations.
    Creativity and flexibility shaped my way of coping with issues as you only face problems you didn't take into consideration and planned ahead for.
    Contribute to an enjoyable working environment within my team 
    I developed and extended my skills in coordination and managing of projects especially in my last position.
    "Good stress" has always been a driver for my work, staying calm and rational and always keep the ball moving during sprints and critical phases.
    Evaluate and establish open source software in my work environments; not on every ocasion possible but when there's clearly benefits over enterprise products.
